feat(database): implement Redis cache layer with OAuth state management

Implemented comprehensive Redis integration following Task 3.4 specifications
with complete connection pooling, helper functions, and OAuth state management
for the authentication flow.

## Core Implementation

### Redis Connection Layer (database/redis.go)
- Established Redis client with go-redis/v9 library
- Configured connection pool with optimal settings:
  - Pool size: 10 connections
  - Min idle connections: 5
  - Dial timeout: 5 seconds
  - Read/Write timeout: 3 seconds
- Implemented ConnectRedis() with URL parsing and health check
- Added PingRedis() for connection verification
- Implemented CloseRedis() for graceful shutdown

### Generic Helper Functions
- SetJSON/GetJSON: Store and retrieve JSON-serialized objects with TTL
- SetString/GetString: Simple string operations with TTL
- Delete: Remove one or multiple keys
- Exists: Check key existence
- SetTTL: Update key expiration time

### OAuth State Management
- SaveOAuthState: Store OAuth state data with 5-minute TTL
- GetOAuthState: Retrieve and auto-delete state (single-use pattern)
- Prefix-based key organization: oauth:state:{token}
- Automatic TTL enforcement for security

## Integration

### Main Application (main.go)
- Integrated Redis connection in startup sequence
- Added Redis health status to /health endpoint
- Configured graceful shutdown with deferred CloseRedis()
- Updated environment validation to require REDIS_URL

### Docker Infrastructure (docker-compose.yml)
- Redis service already configured with Redis 7-alpine
- Health check with redis-cli ping
- Persistent volume for Redis data
- Service dependency in app container

## Testing

### Comprehensive Test Suite (database/redis_test.go)
All tests passing with full coverage:

Connection Management:
- ✅ TestConnectRedis: Successful connection with health check
- ✅ TestConnectRedis_MissingURL: Error handling for missing config
- ✅ TestConnectRedis_InvalidURL: Validation of malformed URLs
- ✅ TestPingRedis: Connection health verification
- ✅ TestPingRedis_NotConnected: Error handling when not connected
- ✅ TestCloseRedis: Graceful connection closure

Helper Functions:
- ✅ TestSetJSON_GetJSON: JSON serialization round-trip
- ✅ TestGetJSON_NotFound: redis.Nil handling for missing keys
- ✅ TestSetString_GetString: String operations with TTL
- ✅ TestGetString_NotFound: Error handling for missing strings
- ✅ TestDelete: Multi-key deletion
- ✅ TestExists: Key existence verification
- ✅ TestSetTTL: TTL update and expiration (3s wait test)

OAuth State Management:
- ✅ TestSaveOAuthState: State persistence with correct TTL
- ✅ TestGetOAuthState: State retrieval and auto-deletion
- ✅ TestGetOAuthState_NotFound: Missing state error handling
- ✅ TestGetOAuthState_ExpiredState: TTL expiration validation (2s wait test)

Benchmark Tests:
- BenchmarkSetJSON: Performance metrics for write operations
- BenchmarkGetJSON: Performance metrics for read operations

## Documentation

### README.md Updates
- Added Redis to tech stack and prerequisites
- Updated quick start guide with Redis connection status
- Marked REDIS_URL as required environment variable
- Updated health check expected response with redis status
- Added Task 3.4 to completed milestones
- Documented Redis in project structure
- Updated all milestone tracking sections

### Environment Configuration
- REDIS_URL now validated as required on startup
- Connection string format: redis://host:port/db
- Example: redis://localhost:6379/0

## Production Readiness

Features implemented for production use:
- Connection pooling prevents resource exhaustion
- Configurable timeouts prevent hanging connections
- Health check integration for monitoring
- Graceful shutdown prevents data loss
- Error handling with descriptive messages
- TTL enforcement for security-sensitive data
- Single-use OAuth states prevent replay attacks

## Technical Details

Dependencies added:
- github.com/redis/go-redis/v9 v9.16.0
- github.com/cespare/xxhash/v2 v2.3.0
- github.com/dgryski/go-rendezvous v0.0.0-20200823014737-9f7001d12a5f

All code follows Go best practices:
- ✅ go fmt ./... - Code formatted
- ✅ go vet ./... - Static analysis passed
- ✅ go test -v ./database - All tests passing (7.6s)
- ✅ go build - Compilation successful

## Validation

Verified complete functionality:
- Docker containers running (postgres, redis, app)
- Health endpoint returns {"database":"ok","redis":"ok","service":"authflow","status":"ok"}
- Redis connection established successfully
- OAuth state TTL configured to 5 minutes
- All 17 Redis tests passing with full coverage

Milestone 3 (Database Layer - Persistence) is now COMPLETE with all 4 tasks:
- Task 3.1: PostgreSQL connection ✅
- Task 3.2: Database schema and migrations ✅
- Task 3.3: Go models implementation ✅
- Task 3.4: Redis setup and integration ✅

Ready to proceed to Milestone 4 (Admin API - Application Management).
