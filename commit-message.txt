test(database): add comprehensive OAuth state management tests

Add extensive test coverage for OAuth state management in Redis:

- Add TestOAuthState_SingleUse: Validates single-use token behavior, ensuring
  states can only be retrieved once and are deleted after first use
- Add TestOAuthState_MultipleStates: Tests handling of multiple concurrent OAuth
  states from different applications
- Add TestOAuthState_ConcurrentAccess: Validates race condition handling when
  multiple goroutines attempt to retrieve the same state simultaneously

These tests ensure the OAuth state management system is robust and secure:
- Single-use tokens prevent replay attacks
- Multiple states are isolated and don't interfere with each other
- Concurrent access is handled safely with only one retrieval succeeding

All tests pass successfully and validate the implementation against security
requirements for OAuth 2.0 flows.

Related to task 5-4-state-management-redis.md which references the existing
implementation in database/redis.go (SaveOAuthState, GetOAuthState).
