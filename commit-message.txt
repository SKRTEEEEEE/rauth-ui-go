feat(server): implement basic Fiber server with health check endpoint

This commit implements Task 2.3 - Basic Server Implementation, establishing
the foundation for the authentication service with a fully functional web server.

## Implementation Details

### Main Server (main.go)
- Initialize Fiber web framework with custom configuration
- Configure application name: "AuthFlow v1.0"
- Implement centralized error handler for consistent error responses
- Add CORS middleware for cross-origin resource sharing
- Add logger middleware for request logging
- Create /health endpoint returning JSON status
- Support configurable PORT from environment (defaults to 8080)
- Graceful startup with emoji indicator for better UX

### Testing (main_test.go)
Comprehensive test suite covering:
- Health endpoint returns 200 OK with correct JSON structure
- Health endpoint only accepts GET method (405 for POST)
- CORS middleware properly handles OPTIONS preflight requests
- Custom error handler returns correct status codes and JSON errors
- 404 handling for non-existent routes
- Response structure validation (status and service fields)

All server-related tests pass successfully ✅

### Docker Configuration
- Uncommented and activated app service in docker-compose.yml
- Configured app to depend on healthy postgres and redis services
- Set environment variables for production-ready deployment
- Exposed port 8080 for external access
- Configured restart policy for reliability

### Build & Deployment
- Multi-stage Dockerfile already in place
- Successfully builds and runs in Docker container
- All three services (app, postgres, redis) running healthy
- Health check verified: returns {"service":"authflow","status":"ok"}

## Testing Results

### Unit Tests
✅ TestHealthEndpoint - All sub-tests pass
✅ TestCORSMiddleware - CORS headers validated
✅ TestErrorHandler - Custom error handling works
✅ TestNotFoundRoute - 404 handling correct
✅ TestHealthResponseStructure - JSON structure validated

### Integration Tests
✅ Docker build successful
✅ All containers start and run healthy
✅ Health endpoint responds correctly at http://localhost:8080/health
✅ Server logs show proper initialization

### Code Quality
✅ go fmt ./... - All files formatted
✅ go vet ./... - No suspicious constructs
✅ go build - Compilation successful (authflow.exe generated)

## Breaking Changes
None. This is new functionality.

## Dependencies Added
All dependencies were already defined in go.mod from previous tasks:
- github.com/gofiber/fiber/v2 v2.52.9
- github.com/gofiber/fiber/v2/middleware/cors
- github.com/gofiber/fiber/v2/middleware/logger
- github.com/joho/godotenv v1.5.1
- github.com/stretchr/testify v1.11.1 (for testing)

## Documentation Updates
- Updated README.md with Task 2.3 completion status
- Added server usage examples and curl commands
- Enhanced Docker section with new app service commands
- Updated build instructions with correct binary name (authflow.exe)

## Verification Steps Performed
1. ✅ Server starts without errors
2. ✅ GET /health returns 200 OK
3. ✅ Response is valid JSON: {"service":"authflow","status":"ok"}
4. ✅ CORS is enabled (allows all origins for development)
5. ✅ Logger shows requests in console
6. ✅ Port is configurable via PORT environment variable
7. ✅ Docker services start and communicate correctly
8. ✅ All tests pass (except expected failures for future dependencies)

## Next Steps
Task 2.4: Configure environment variables and validation (.env setup)
